Fossevents.in
===============

Vision:
---------
FOSS communities thrive in a collaborative environment in virtual spaces on Internet.
Events are a  way to meet physically and also introduce newbies to FOSS culture. We believe Fossevents will help communities meet physically more often .This will enhance learning and bonding between community members.

What?
-----------
Fossevents.in is a crowdsourced foss events listing site.
This is a rewrite of the existing site which was created using Drupal a few years back

Why ?
--------
* Many a times when we are busy with our lives we loose track of what FOSS events are happening in our neighbourhood.

* When we  travel, we would like to know what FOSS events are happpening in other cities in that time frame.

* FOSS events are few in India, and the ones that are there are under-promoted. We want the numbers of both FOSS events and attendees to increase in India.

FAQ
--------
 
* Q:What event can be submitted to the listing?
 
 A: Any event which is free and open source preferably driven by community is encouraged.
 
* Q: What happens if I am a Windows open source developer and I want to demo it at an event?
 
 A: Its perfectly ok with any operating system as long as the demoed software falls under any of the Free and Open Source license it wil be entertained in an event .

* Q: Is this only for hackathons or codefests?

 A: Not at all, the FOSS movement started with software but now the broader movement includes open data (e.g., Openstreetmaps, Wikipedia) and many allied ideas.
